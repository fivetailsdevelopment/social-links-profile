# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

![Design preview for the Social links profile coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge was to build out this social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to: 

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## The solution

- The solution here was done without using Figma files so there might be some differences in element sizing
